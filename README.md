# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Word Frequency Analyzer is a C++ program designed to analyze the frequency of words within a text file, providing users with functionalities to retrieve word frequencies, display frequency lists, generate histograms, and create a backup file containing the word frequencies.The project aimed to address the need for efficiently calculating and visualizing word frequencies in a text document. It offers a user-friendly interface to analyze word occurrences, aiding in data comprehension and backup storage of frequency data.

# What did you do particularly well?
Implementation of an object-oriented approach using the WordCounter class for encapsulation and code organization. Efficient use of the map data structure to store word frequencies.String manipulations for standardizing word formats.Proper error handling for file operations and user input validation.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Enhance error handling for edge cases and improve user input validation robustness. Optimize code for better memory usage and efficiency in word frequency calculations. Implement additional error messages and guidance for user inputs to enhance user experience.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was handling user inputs and ensuring consistent formatting of words. Overcoming this involved using string manipulation techniques and character handling functions from <cctype> header to standardize word formats.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Proficiency in object-oriented programming principles in C++. Understanding and utilization of data structures for efficient data storage and retrieval.
Improved skills in error handling, input validation, and file operations. Enhancing code readability through encapsulation and modular design.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Encapsulation of functionalities within the WordCounter class promotes maintainability and readability. The code is well-commented to explain functionality and enhance readability for future developers. Modular design allows easy adaptation or extension of functionalities for future improvements.
